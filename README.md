Projects about Analisis and Algorithm Syntesis

First project consists of finding the Longest path in a graph

Second project consists on implementing the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum cut (solution with the least cost) in a graph

Generate random DAGS with:

Compilation: g++ -O3 -Wall -o randomDAG randomDAG.cpp -lm
Execution: ./randomDAG N p [seed] > testfile
